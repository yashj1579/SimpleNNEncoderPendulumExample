# Pendulum Dynamics Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a neural network can learn the dynamics of a simple pendulum and predict future states based on past trajectories. The project combines classical mechanics, neural networks, and data-driven modeling to create a visually engaging and educational simulation.

### What This Project Teaches

* Generating data from exact ODE integration for a pendulum.
* Normalizing and preprocessing trajectories for neural network training.
* Implementing a feedforward neural network (encoder-decoder) in PyTorch to predict future states.
* Training a neural network using mean squared error (MSE) loss and visualizing training/testing performance.
* Creating animated visualizations of both real and predicted pendulum trajectories.

### What I Did

* Implemented `ExactODE.py` to numerically integrate pendulum dynamics.
* Built `NNTraining.py` to preprocess data, create an encoder-decoder NN, train it, and save the model and normalization parameters.
* Created `NNBasedSimulation.py` to load the trained model, generate predictions, and animate the pendulum with predicted trajectories.
* Added visualization enhancements including trailing points, fading markers, and color-coded predictions.

### Potential Future Improvements

* Extend to double pendulum or cart-pole dynamics.
* Incorporate Neural ODEs for continuous-time prediction.
* Add physics-informed losses to enforce energy conservation.
* Improve animation with smoother transitions or interactive controls.
* Explore RNNs or transformers to predict longer trajectories more accurately.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and the following packages installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib torch

---

### 2. Generate Pendulum Data

The data is generated automatically in `NNTraining.py` using the `ExactODE.exact_integration` function.

You can modify:

* `t` → the time vector
* `x_init` → initial pendulum angle & velocity
* `lens` → number of previous points used for prediction

### 3. Train the Neural Network

Run the training script:

python NNTraining.py

The script will:

1. Normalize the data
2. Split it into training and testing sets
3. Train an encoder-decoder neural network
4. Save the trained model (`pendulum_model.pth`) and normalization parameters (`normalization.npz`)
5. Plot training and testing loss curves

---

### 4. Run the Neural Network Simulation & Animation

Run the animation script:

python NNBasedSimulation.py

The script will:

1. Load the trained model and normalization parameters
2. Generate predictions for each frame based on previous trajectory points
3. Animate the pendulum in real-time, showing:

   * The actual pendulum (green)
   * Previous trajectory (orange fading trail)
   * Predicted trajectory (red fading trail)
4. Save the animation as `pendulum.mp4`
